These input files all have the "test_embedding" and "use_existing_weights" paths set to True. What this will do when run with the normal script (main_cv) is open an interactive mode. The already-trained model at the specified "model_path" will be loaded - in this case, it is a single fold from a 5-fold CV. You can then enter the SMILES strings of molecules whose fingerprint representation you'd like to see. They will be saved in the model's original output folder.
